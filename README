Harfang is a lightweight Web development framework written in the haXe language (http://haxe.org), currently aimed at the PHP target.

There is no official documentation for the framework yet (other than the class documentation).

There is, however, a very very simple demo showing basic configuration and URL dispatching in "src/server".

Here is how to run it :
 - Compile the demo by running haxe on the "build.xml" file.
 - Put every file in the "out" directory in a folder named "harfang" on your Web server.
 - Move the "htaccess" file into the "harfang" folder and rename it ".htaccess"

In order for the demo to work, you will need to have PHP enabled, with support for URL rewriting.

Enjoy!
